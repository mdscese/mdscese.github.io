            </h1>
            <p>
                Completed in the spring of 2024 this is the website you are on.
                It is a project portfolio to accompany my resume now that I have decided to search for professional work.
                It should hopefully provide some insight into who I am and what I have done while also flexxing my webpage building skills.
            </p>
            <h1>
                Implementation:
            </h1>
            <p>
                This website is primarily developed using HTML and CSS, supplemented with a minimal usage of JavaScript to ensure real-time updates of certain information.
                The primary focus of the website is the main page, designed to highlight the most recent projects.
                Additionally, it features an archive and an "About Me" page, showcasing all recorded projects and providing insight into the creator, respectively.
                Furthermore, the website includes a series of project pages, offering comprehensive details about each individual project.
            </br></br>
                At this time there is only a small amount of work I would like to continue with on this project and that includes such tasks as code cleanup and improving site load times.

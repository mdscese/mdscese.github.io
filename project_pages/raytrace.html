                Description:
            </h1>
            <p>
                In the autumn of 2022, I finalized a compact and modular raytracer capable of running on any device that supports compiled C programs.
                This versatile tool not only provides real-time outputs but also enables smooth camera movement in real-time through keyboard and mouse inputs.
                Additionally, the raytracer features extensions facilitating the swift and seamless creation of new rendered scenes.

            <h1>
                Implementation:
            </h1>
            <p>
                The raytracer project is constructed entirely from the ground up using C. It leverages SDL2, the sole external library, offering seamless access to low-level controls and effortlessly created output windows.
                At its core, the project employs vector math libraries to formulate a series of intricate mathematical equations, enabling the creation of rays projected from a camera through a frame to capture pixel colors.
                This process iterates for each desired pixel in an output frame, demanding rigorous calculations with complex linear algebra to dynamically define every aspect, allowing the camera placement anywhere within the scene.
                Scene creation is facilitated within the in-program scene editor, introducing a novel file type that meticulously describes the positioning and properties of every object to be rendered, alongside global scene settings.

                If I were to add more to this project advanced culling processes would be a logical starting point, followed by the integration of mesh loaders for scenes, implementation of proper refraction, exploration of global illumination techniques, and the incorporation of graphics acceleration options.

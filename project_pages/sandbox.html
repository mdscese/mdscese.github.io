                Description:
            </h1>
            <p>
                In spring of 2023, I completed my first alternative reality project: an interactive sandbox. Participants can manipulate the sand's height, and the terrain height map images adjust accordingly, reflecting the changes made within the sandbox.

                Implementation:
            </h1>
            <p>
                The project utilizes a standard Walmart bin filled with white sand, accompanied by a custom construction housing a short throw projector and a Microsoft Kinect v2.
                The Kinect interfaces with a computational device running a Python program, which separates the three visual signals a Kinect can return.
                Primary processing occurs on the infrared image, identifying the corners of the sand utilizing OpenCV corner detection algorithms and reflective tape.
                The corner detection process is further enhanced by utilizing CUDA technology to improve processing speeds.
                A mask and transform are then created from the infrared images corner points and applied to the height map image defining the shape and contents of what will be displayed.
                Finally a custom OpenCV color range application applies colors based on the height map's gradient.
                </br></br>
                This project emphasis modularity due to lower quality components this modularity facilitate flexibility.
                As of now the only component that needs direct alignment is the projector as it must be aligned so the throw of the image matches the edges of the display surface.
                Future iterations may involve making the projector more modular, by utilizing a pre-display tuning image that the Kinect could detect and provide some processing on.
                Improvements such as this would allow the projector's throw to be somewhat off by trading some visual clarity for improved flexibility.
